# SmartMess 🍽️

**SmartMess** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to streamline and digitize hostel mess operations. It provides role-based access for students and admins, enabling smooth management of attendance, complaints, menu updates, rebate applications, notices, and payments.

> Both frontend and backend are hosted on **Vercel**.

## 👤 Login Credentials

- **Admin Email:** `admin@example.com`
